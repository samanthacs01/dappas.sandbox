# Pulse Web App

This is a web app for the Pulse project. It is built with Next.js and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Change the values of the environment variables in the `.env.local` file to match your local environment.

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
